# Movies-ETL
## Overview: 

For this challenge, we were tasked with creating an automated pipeline that takes in new movie and ratings data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We had to refactor the code from module 8, in order to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
